A simple script that scrapes the NBA homepage for .swf links to a given night's NBA game recaps. It then uses [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) to download them to your current directory and then opens them in your default media player. I created this script because it was getting incredibly redundant to navigate to each video link every morning. Now, one click and they are running on my local machine _(with no ads!)_.
