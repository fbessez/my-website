Stop spending 30 minutes navigating through NBA.com, watching ads and waiting for buffering. NBA Daily Recaps neatly compiles all of the Game Recaps from the NBA of the night before (default) for your ease of viewing. No ads, no wait, no NBA.com. Just run the script and the game recaps begin playing on your default media player.
