Use Tinder API Client to easily interact with the robust data passing through [Tinder's](https://tinder.com) APIs. Originally used as a tool to understand what kind of personal information of mine was available in the public via Tinder, Tinder API Client now makes it easy to write bots, filters, searches, data aggregation tools etc.
